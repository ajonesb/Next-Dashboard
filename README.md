## Sr. Software Engineer VoyceMe Take-Home Test

Thank you for your interest in VoyceMe. We are excited to welcome you to the take-home test portion of the process.

## TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT: HOW WOULD YOU DESIGN VOYCE.ME?

## Assumptions

## Assume that Voyce.me has the 2 features listed below

- Admin Portal - Developed with React (Next js) and Charts.js for data interactivity
  `https://www.chartjs.org/`

- Coin System
  You may make any other necessary assumptions as long as you are able to clearly define these

## High-Level System Design

- Include all components - The architecture is designed with reusable components.
- Consider scalability and potential third-party API Intergrations - The application is ready to scale with adding additional pages to the dashboard as well as reusing the
  components available such as Header, LeftNavBar, Layout, View.

## Admin Portal

- Using the data available and you assumptions above, Create a very basic Admin Portal for Voyce.me using next.js. The Admin Portal does not have to be fully functional
- Share the link to the GitHub repo with us
- Deployment is not necessary but would be nice to have.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

- use nvm (if not installed, install nvm first - yarn add nvm 12)
  nvm use 12

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
